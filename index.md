## Create your own online course (and keep it)

Course in a Box is an open source, online course creation tool. It is designed to minimize the amount of time you need to spend fumbling around with technology, allowing you to focus on bringing together the resources, activities, and lessons that you want to share with the world.

Course materials are written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and hosted on [Github](https://www.github.com), a popular development platform that allows for collaborative drafting, version control, and easy dissemination of your course.

Using Course in a Box and hosting a course on Github are **completely free**, and we’ve outlined the process for putting together a course [on our blog](https://info.p2pu.org/2019/05/16/creating-an-open-course-with-p2pu/). If you’d like to hire us to help you set things up and/or co-design the course with you, [we can do that](https://www.p2pu.org/en/work-with-us/). 


Here are some recent courses that have been built with Course in a Box:

- [Learning to (re)use open educational resources](http://www.exploerercourse.org/) by Creative Commons & Open University
- [Create and sustain effective makerspaces in your community](http://p2pu.github.io/makingandlearning/) by Pittsburgh Children’s Museum
- [Learning about learning circles](https://p2pu.github.io/facilitate-course/) by P2PU


## Reach new audiences

Online courses take a big step forwards in the sharing of knowledge around the world. However, your course is only ever as good as the people it reaches. To help reach new audiences with online courses, P2PU developed learning circles: groups for people who take online courses together, in local libraries or community spaces.

Once you create a course, you can add it to P2PU’s learning circle [course page](http://p2pu.org/en/courses/), a growing database of online courses that people are using to facilitate learning circles around the world. You can also check out our [facilitator page](https://www.p2pu.org/en/facilitate/) to learn how to run your own learning circle.
