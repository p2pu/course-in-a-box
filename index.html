    <h2>Create a learning community that lasts</h2>
    <p>You sign up for a free online course, and suddenly there's an influx of steady introductions. You don't know where to go, who to talk to, who to ask for help. Between the anxiety of what to do next and the sterile course materials, you get bored. You stop reading the emails. You drop out.</p>
    <p>Online courses often feel large, intimidating and anonymous. That's the reason they aren't sticky. It's hard to feel invested in multiple choice quizzes, textbook chapters and hum-drum Q & A forums.</p>
    <p>In a stellar learning experiece, you'd know who was in the room and feel super-comfy. You'd make projects together, and find help when you get stuck. You'd want to send people thank-you cards and chicken soup.</p>
    <p>We know designing a creative, participatory community can be a bit tricky. We're here to help you craft assignments that rule, build an audience and support you along the way. You'll even learn a few technical skills in the process. Don't worry--the 1s and 0s wash off pretty easily.</p>
    
    <h2>OK, but who are you guys?</h2>
    <p>We're <a href="http://p2pu.org">Peer 2 Peer University</a>--we build learning communities on the web. In our 5 years of experience, we put together courses like <a href="http://www.playwithyourmusic.org/">Play With Your Music</a>, <a href="http://learn.media.mit.edu/lcl/">Learning Creative Learning</a>, the <a href="http://dlmooc.deeper-learning.org/">Deeper Learning MOOC</a>, and <a href="http://mechanicalmooc.org/">A Gentle Intro to Python</a>. Also, we're a non-profit and a distributed team (so we use the tools we recommend).
