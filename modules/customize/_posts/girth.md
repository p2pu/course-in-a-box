## Add Single Pages

If you have extra content that you donâ€™t want to fit within a course module (contact page, credits, reference guides, etc), you can also set up single pages. These pages will appear with no left-hand sidebar, just a top navigation and a central space to fill with your content.

<center><img src="/img/example-single-page.png" alt="Screenshot of an example single page" width="75%"/></center>
<br>

Adding a single page is similar to [making a submodule](../../content/submodules/). Create a new `.md` file in the root folder of your project. You can name it anything you wantâ€”the name of the file will turn into its URL in the browser. (Ex: `single-page.md` turns into `https://course-in-a-box.p2pu.org/single-page`)

Add this chunk of code (aka front matter) at the top of your file:

```
---
layout: page
---
```

Underneath that, you can add your Markdown-formatted content however youâ€™d like. ðŸ˜Ž

Note that this file wonâ€™t automatically appear in the top navigation bar of your course or anywhere else unless you specifically link to it. For information on adding links, see the [Markdown and Media](../../content/markdown-and-media) page. To add a link to your nav bar, head to the next section, [Add Links to the Top Menu](../top-menu).
