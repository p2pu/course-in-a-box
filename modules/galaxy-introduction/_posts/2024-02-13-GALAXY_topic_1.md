# Introduction to Galaxy
---

### Getting started with Galaxy

In our training we will be using the [Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org) bioinformatics platform. 
<br>
<br>

> [!WARNING]  
> We will be using the **European** Galaxy server [here](https://usegalaxy.eu).

<br>

Sign up for usegalaxy.eu is free. Select the _Login or Register_ item at the top right to sign up.
<br>
<br>
The Galaxy Training Network (GTN) provides tutorials on doing bioinformatics analysis and data science using Galaxy and we will be using some of this materials in the course.

#### Introductory materials on Galaxy

What is Galaxy? See the slides [here](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/introduction/tutorials/introduction/slides.html). To find out more about Galaxy and using Galaxy, read about [Galaxy Resources for Research](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dgKt1KJEazVPLmUXoXDUKgQl4hu1-Mute_AhSt183lQ/edit#slide=id.p) and see some common [Questions and Answers about Galaxy](https://www.slideshare.net/kbradnam/13-questions-you-might-have-about-galaxy).

#### First hands on with Galaxy

Firstly, if you are part of the March 2024 training at SANBI, log into usegalaxy.eu and click [this link](https://usegalaxy.eu/join-training/training-path-gen-march-24) to register as part of the training group. This will ensure that you have priority access to computing resources during our training. **Remember** that you must first **be logged in** to usegalaxy.eu before clicking this link.

To get used to the interface, start with [A Short Introduction To Galaxy](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-short/tutorial.html). This will get you used to uploading data, running tools, doing some basic work with Galaxy Histories and also give you a first introduction to Galaxy Workflows.

After completing that tutorial, proceed to [Galaxy 101 for Everyone](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/introduction/tutorials/galaxy-intro-101-everyone/tutorial.html), which uses data analysis of the well-known (in the history of statistics) _Iris flower dataset_ as a slightly longer introduction to using Galaxy.

#### A note on Sharing Histories

When you are working with Galaxy, trainers might ask you to "share your history" so that they can see what you have been working on. Similar to how
one shares documents or folders on Google Docs or Dropbox. This gives the person you are sharing with access to the data in your history, so that they can check on your progress and help you with any errors that you may encounter. Read this [FAQ Entry on How to Share a History](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/faqs/galaxy/histories_sharing.html).
