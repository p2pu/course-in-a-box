# E-Mail Links

A very common type of hyperlinking, is to create an e-mail link within a page. This is accomplished by prepending “`mailto:`” to the desired e-mail address. So, to create a hyperlink that e-mails me:

```html
<a href="mailto:michael.musick@umontana.edu">Email Michael!</a>
```

Clicking on such a link in a webpage will cause the webpage to try and open the users default e-mail application. 

Try it for your self:
<a href="mailto:michael.musick@umontana.edu">Email Michael!</a>

For this reason, it is also good practice to write the full e-mail address out.
