# Welcome to Web Development (MART 341)

## Overview of the Course
This course is intended to make you comfortable with presenting yourself through the web. In addition, you will learn skills that should allow you to build, manage, and develop websites.

This course will start with an overview of technologies used for web development. This will be followed by an in depth presentation HTML and CSS. The course will conclude by exploring responsive web design, site frameworks, advanced CSS, and site management solutions.

This is exclusively on-line course. As such, you will be expected to engage with all content through the main site. You will be assessed through regular project-based assignments, writings, and community engagement. The course will conclude with a final site build.



## What to Expect

This course will force you to learn and adapt to new technologies, while also thinking about design, and content creation. Some weeks will lean more technical in nature, while others (albeit fewer) will lean more design-based.

Just as the content focus will shift, so to will the work amount. Some weeks, espeially those when new topics are being introduced, have a heavier workload. The goal of this is to make you practice with these new technologies and techniques. Other weeks will slow down and allow you to practice at a more exploratory pace.


## Homework
You should consider anything within the course lecture content under a *{ TODO: }* section to be part of your "homework".

You will recieve additional directives and notes on the homework page for each assignment in the ["homework wiki"](https://github.com/Montana-Media-Arts/341-work/wiki). Instructions will be provided how to do this over the next two weeks.



## Class Goals and the Final Project
The main goal of this course is to allow you an opportunity to become comfortable with technologies used in web design. Another primary goal is to get you thinking about web design and possibilities for content creation via the web. Your homework through the semester will build on these two ideas.

The final project will be a site of your making. (i.e. this could be a personal web site, product web site, or organization site).
