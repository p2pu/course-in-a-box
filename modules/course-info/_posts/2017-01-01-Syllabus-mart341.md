-   **GitHub**
	-   Additionally, you will be expected to maintain a [github.io](https://pages.github.com) repository and website via [GitHub](https://github.com) where you will post your weekly homework assignments.
-   **Browser**
	-   You should ensure you have a modern browser installed on your computer, such as Safari, Google Chrome, or Firefox.


## Server Hosting
You are expected to use an appropriate hosting solution for your work this semester. In most cases, you are expected, and encouraged to use the free github.io solution. However, in some instances, you may be expected to purchase hosting space for your work in the last third of the semester. In such a case, we recommend [BlueHost.org](https://www.bluehost.com).

# Policies

## Course Evaluation

We will have weekly assignments that are relevant to material from the previous class. These assignments are required and you will need to talk about them in your technical reports. It is expected that everyone in the class will create and maintain a github repository for their assignments.

This class will be participatory, you are expected to participate in discussions and give feedback to other students through on-line participation with their projects.

This course will culminate with final projects. You are expected to push your abilities to produce something that utilizes what you have learned in the class that is useful in some manner to yourself or the world. Typically, this will be a multi-page personal website.

### Assessment Guidelines
Grades for all assignments will be based primarily on the student’s ability to:

1.  Demonstrate an understanding of the specific characteristics and integrative capabilities of the assigned topic in your own words and code.
2.  Articulate a clear and concise perspective. Cutting and pasting or copying word for word off the Internet will result in loss of points.
3.  Present an organized file/program, as well as technical report; including proper and punctual delivery of the assignment files.
4.  Demonstrate creativity beyond the expected technical requirements.


IMPORTANT: Assignments handed in after the due date and time will have points deducted for lateness. This will be in addition to any points deducted for content. Those that are uploaded late but within one week of the due date will lose 5% for lateness.  For those uploaded after that, the number of deducted points will be at the discretion of the faculty.


### Grade Break Down   
Grades will be determined according to the following breakdown:

-   Regular Assignments 50%
-   Participation 20%
-   Final Project 30%

Letters are assigned according to the following final course percentages:

- A   95-100
- A-  90-94
- B+  86-89
- B   83-85
- B-  80-82
- C+  76-79
- C   73-75
- C-  70-72
- D   60-69
- F   0-59


### Academic Misconduct and the Student Conduct Code

All students must practice academic honesty. Academic misconduct is subject to an academic penalty by the course instructor and/or disciplinary sanction by the University. All students need to be familiar with the Student Conduct Code. The Code is available online at [http://www.umt.edu/vpsa/policies/student_conduct.php](http://www.umt.edu/vpsa/policies/student\_conduct.php)

## Changes to the Course
I reserve the right to change the intended content of this course throughout the semester. This may be done to adjust for the speed of the class, to better meet educational goals, or to account for changes in technology.
